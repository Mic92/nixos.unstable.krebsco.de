Disclamer
=========

</p>

Well, this is my first post. I will post code i am working with here.

</p>

Most of the code snippets will be pseudo-code ( tagged by the hash
questionmark \#? ). The code can be seen as an digest of the `history`
command of my shell or my texteditor.

</p>

Be sure not to simply copy-paste my stuff as it will most likely break
because i havenâ€™t tested it myself after writing this up even though it
*looks* correct ;).

</p>

I will mostly not describe what this stuff does more than the head line
and probably some tags as i think code is the only thing that matters in
the end, everything else can be read up somewhere else.

</p>

I guess this blog is somewhat like `Gist` or `Command Line Kung Fu`, but
only containing stuff important for me and my work.

</p>
