I decided i will share my adventures through `NixOS <https://nixos.org/>` and
more specifically following either the `NixOS Unstable Channel <https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/index.html#sec-upgrading>`_ or the Latest NixOS Stable Channel.

The Blog posts will contain the Git Hash and the time i updated. It will be mostly a short problem description and how (or how not) i fixed it all together with code blocks and links to extra descriptions.
