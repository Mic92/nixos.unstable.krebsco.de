I decided i will share my adventures through `NixOS <https://nixos.org/>`_ and
more specifically following either the `NixOS Unstable Channel <https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/index.html#sec-upgrading>`_ or the Latest NixOS Stable Channel.

The Blog posts will contain the Git Hash and the time i updated. It will be mostly a short problem description and how (or how not) i fixed it all together with code blocks and links to extra descriptions. I will try to convince more people becoming contributors to this blog.

The sources can be found in a dedicated `Github Repository <https://github.com/krebscode/nixos.unstable.krebsco.de>`_ ,the website gets deployed by `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/krebscode/nixos.unstable.krebsco.de/>`_ and delivered via the `Github Pages CDN <https://pages.github.com/>`_
